# Dengue Epidemic Predictor

# Problem Statement
Dengue fever is a mosquito-borne disease that occurs in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world and has been observed to be spreading. Symptoms are similar to the flu: fever, rash, and muscle and joint pain. In severe cases, dengue fever can cause severe bleeding, low blood pressure, and even death. Since it is carried by mosquitoes, the transmission dynamics of dengue are related to climate variables such as temperature and precipitation. Historically, the disease has been most prevalent in Southeast Asia and the Pacific islands. Dengue incidences follows seasonal transmission patterns followed by cyclic larger epidemics. In areas where dengue is endemic, incidence follows seasonal transmission patterns punctuated every few years by much larger epidemics. Because these epidemics are unpredictable and of major consequence to the affected populations. 

The goal of our project is to develop a model that will forecast total number of cases in a transmission season â€“ by using historical climatic variables (cyclic and seasonal time series from the past) and the number of dengue cases (confirmed or suspected, depending on the location) reported in the transmission season.
Optimal prediction results can be utilized by local policy makers to plan ahead and allocate required resources to manage the epidemic and save lives.
